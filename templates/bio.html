Being a freestyle swim coach for cockroaches presents challenges due to their small size, communication barrier, fear of water, and short attention span. However, the novelty and innovation in this profession allow for creative coaching techniques, fostering a sense of empathy and providing a unique understanding of nature. Witnessing cockroaches overcome their limitations and glide through the water brings great satisfaction, while the experience offers humour and lightheartedness. Additionally, studying their swimming behaviour may contribute to scientific discoveries in biology or robotics, making this unconventional coaching role both rewarding and intriguing.
