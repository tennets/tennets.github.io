                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            I am currently looking for <b>job opportunities where I can build technologies for real social impact</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I completed my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.upc.edu/en">UPC</a> under the supervision of <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.lacan.upc.edu/user/pedro-diez/">Pedro Diez</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.lacan.upc.edu/user/berto.garcia/">Alberto Garcia</a>, where I developed data-driven finite element and machine learning models to support doctors' decision-making processes when analysing atherosclerosis--the <a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.09.020">leading cause of heart attacks</a>.
                            <br>
                            Also, I was a software engineer at <a class="ext-link" href="https://nemeda.io/">Nemeda</a> where I develop dynamic optimisation and classification algorithms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I feel alive when driven by my curiosity and when I realise I can comfortably stay out of my comfort zone; embracing the "unknown" has profoundly shaped both my career and personal life. 
                            This philosophy compels me to use hard science with a focus on social projects to enhance people's lives, regardless of their current visibility or popularity.
